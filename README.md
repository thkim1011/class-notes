# On the Organization of Class Notes

## Introduction
Hello! This is a small python script for managing notes that I take for my
classes. The idea is that this is supposed to be somewhat similar to git except
that it is used to upload to a google drive instead. Currently, I have 
something working, but needs a lot of improvements. If you wish to use this,
then the best way to work with this is to look at the code. The docstrings
should be of help as to what works right now. 

## To do

* Work on a better set of commands.
* Figure out where to put credentials.json for google api.
* Find a better way to organize google drive api requests.
* Figure out how python package structure works.
